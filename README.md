This is a basic react app for an imaginary law firm. Nice little project to add to github when I feel ready.
It was based off of this app:

Also used this link for a parralax effect - cool 3d background feature:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-parallax

I kind of lost motivation as it isnt mobile friendly. I feel any app in this day and age that isnt mobile friendly
is not a great modern day application. I plan to move onto react native at this point and learn the skills required
to make mobile applications. Being able to come back and apply what I learn here would be great. 

Still needs:
- A footer
- A contact form
- Working nav links
