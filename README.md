This is the first website I have decided to create in my journey to find a career as a web developer. It is a simple website for a law firm written with React. This also happens to be my first time properly learning and utilising git and github.

My intent is to create a website that simply advertises a business, which functions correctly on both mobile and desktop. This is more of an exercise in CSS and the use of git/github. The website offers little in terms of backend functionality.

I have never used a parallax effect before, this was a good opportunity to do so and I think it looks quite proffesional. Also used this link for a parralax effect - cool 3d background feature:
