This was the first website I decided to create. It is a simple website for a law firm written with React. This also happened to be my first time properly learning and utilising git/github.

My intent was to create a website that simply advertises a business, which functions correctly on both mobile and desktop. This was more of an exercise in CSS and the use of git/github.

I had never used a parallax effect before. This was a good opportunity to do so and I was quite happy with the end result, I believe it looked quite proffesional. This link leads to the page for the parralax effect - https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-parallax
