This is the first website I have taken upon myself to create in my journey to find a career as a web developer. It is a simple website for a law firm written with React.

My intent is to have it function correctly on both mobile and desktop. I beleive if I am to become competent in designing web applications I need to continue to independently make more.

I have never used a parallax effect before, this was a good opportunity to do so and I think it looks quite proffesional. Also used this link for a parralax effect - cool 3d background feature:
